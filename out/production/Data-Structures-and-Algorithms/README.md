### **DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS JAVA** 

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are two important aspects of any programming language. Every programming language has its own data structures and different types of algorithms to handle these data structures.

Data Structures are used to organise and store data to use it in an effective way when performing data operations.

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way. So, as a programmer, data structures and algorithms are really important aspects of day-to-day programming.
